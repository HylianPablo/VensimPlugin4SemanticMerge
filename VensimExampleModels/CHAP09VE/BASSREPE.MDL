		The Bass Innovation Diffusion Model with Repeat Purchases
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the classic Bass innovation diffusion model, adapted
		to separate initial and repeat purchases explicitly.  Adopters
		purchase a certain quantity on initial adoption and then consume
		and repurchase at another rate thereafter.
		Chapter 9.
	|

Initial Purchase Rate=
	Initial Sales per Adopter*Adoption Rate AR
	~	Units/Year
	~	Each adopter buys a quantity equal to Initial Sales per Adopter when they \
		first purchase the product.
	|

Initial Sales per Adopter=
	1
	~	Units/Person
	~	The number of units initially purchased, on average.
	|

Potential Adopters P= INTEG (
	-Adoption Rate AR,
		Total Population N - Adopters A)
	~	People
	~	The initial number of potential adopters is determined by the total \
		population size and the current number of active adopters.  Adoption \
		reduces the stock of potential adopters.
	|

Repeat Purchase Rate=
	Average Consumption per Adopter*Adopters A
	~	Units/Year
	~	The number of units consumed and repurchased each period.
	|

Sales Rate=
	Initial Purchase Rate+Repeat Purchase Rate
	~	Units/Year
	~	Total sales consist of initial and repeat purchases.
	|

Average Consumption per Adopter=
	0.2
	~	Units/Person/Year
	~	Average per capita consumption of the product.
	|

Adoption Rate AR=
	Adoption from Advertising + Adoption from Word of Mouth
	~	People/Year
	~	The rate at which a potential adopter becomes an active adopter. This is \
		driven by advertising efforts and the word of mouth effect.
	|

Advertising Effectiveness a=
	0.011
	~	1/Year
	~	Advertising results in adoption according the effectiveness of the \
		advertising.
	|

Adoption from Advertising=
	Advertising Effectiveness a*Potential Adopters P
	~	People/Year
	~	Adoption can result from advertising according to the effectiveness of the \
		advertising effort with the pool of potential adopters.
	|

Total Population N=
	1e+006
	~	People
	~	The size of the total population.
	|

Adoption from Word of Mouth=
	Contact Rate c*Adoption Fraction i*Potential Adopters P*Adopters A/Total Population N
	~	People/Year
	~	Adoption by word of mouth is driven by the contact rate between potential \
		adopters and active adopters and the fraction of times these interactions \
		will result in adoption. The word of mouth effect is small if the number \
		of active adopters relative to the total population size is small.
	|

Contact Rate c=
	100
	~	1/Year
	~	The rate at which active adopters come into contact with potential \
		adopters.
	|

Adopters A= INTEG (
	Adoption Rate AR,
		0)
	~	People
	~	The number of active adopters in the system.
	|

Adoption Fraction i=
	0.015
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of times a contact between an active adopter and a potential \
		adopter results in adoption.

	~	Year
	~	The final time for the simulation.
