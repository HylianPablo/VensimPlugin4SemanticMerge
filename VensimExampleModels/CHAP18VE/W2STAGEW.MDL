		Two-Stage Supply Chain Model with Variable Delivery Delay Expectations
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model, developed in chapter 18, represents a 2-stage supply chain.
		The producer bases its orders for materials on their expectation of the
		supplier's delivery delay.
		
		To replicate the case where delivery delay expectations are constant,
		Set the Materials Delivery Delay Perception Time to infinity, or set the
		Table for Expected Delivery Delay to 1 for all values of the input.
	|

Material Usage Rate 0=
	Desired Material Usage Rate 0*Material Usage Ratio 0
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The material usage rate is the desired usage rate multiplied by the \
		fraction of the desired rate achieved (the material usage ratio).   Usage \
		falls below desired usage when the feasible usage rate falls below the \
		desired rate, indicating that some materials are unavailable.
	|

Order Rate 0=
	Material Order Rate
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The incoming order rate, equal to customer orders.  For the supplier, \
		customer orders are the orders for materials placed by the downstream firm.
	|

Adjustment for Material Inventory 0=
	(Desired Material Inventory 0 - Materials Inventory 0)/Material Inventory Adjustment Time 0
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The desired material delivery rate is adjusted in proportion to the gap \
		between the desired and actual material inventory.  The material inventory \
		adjustrment time represents the time over which the firm seeks to \
		eliminate materials inventory shortfalls or surpluses.
	|

Adjustment for Materials on Order=
	 (Desired Materials on Order - Materials on Order)/Supply Line Adjustment Time
	~	Materials/Week

		the supply line
		         of materials on order to the desired level.

Adjustment from Inventory 0 = (Desired Inventory 0 - Inventory 0)/
Inventory Adjustment Time 0
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The desired production rate is adjusted above or below the forecast based on the \
		inventory position
		        of the plant.  When desired inventory > inventory, desired production is \
		increased (and
		         vice-versa).  Inventory gaps are corrected over the inv. adj. \
		time.
	|

Materials Inventory Coverage 0=
	XIDZ(Materials Inventory 0,Material Usage Rate 0,1e+006)

	|

Desired Inventory Coverage 0=
	 Minimum Order Processing Time 0 + Safety Stock Coverage 0
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired inventory coverage is the number of weeks of the demand forecast the plant \
		seeks to maintain
		        in inventory.  This inventory coverage is required to maintain delivery \
		reliability by
		         buffering the plant against unforeseen variations in demand or \
		production.  It consists of the normal order processing time plus an \
		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.
