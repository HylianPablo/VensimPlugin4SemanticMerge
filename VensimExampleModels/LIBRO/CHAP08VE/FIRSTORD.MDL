		This is the generic linear, first-order negativee feedback
		system.  Chapter 8.
	|

S State of the System= INTEG (
	-Net Outflow Rate,
		Initial State of the System)
	~	Units
	~	The state of the system is reduced by the net outflow.
	|

Initial State of the System=
	100
	~	Units
	~	The initial quantity in the stock.
	|

Net Outflow Rate=
	d Fractional Decay Rate * S State of the System
	~	Units/Period
	~	The net outflow is proportional to the state of the system.
	|

d Fractional Decay Rate=
	0.05
	~	1/Period
	~	The fractional decay rate for the system.

FINAL TIME  = 100
	~	Period
	~	The final time for the simulation.
	|

INITIAL TIME  = 0
	~	Period
	~	The initial time for the simulation.
	|

SAVEPER  = 
        TIME STEP
	~	Period
	~	The frequency with which output is stored.
	|

TIME STEP  = 1
	~	Period
	~	The time step for the simulation.
