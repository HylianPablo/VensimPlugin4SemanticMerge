********************************************************	.SI-InnovationModel********************************************************~				The SI Model of Infectious Disease Applied to Innovation		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman				This is the SI (Susceptible-Infectious) model of infectious disease		adapted to represent innovation diffusion.  The terminology has been		changed to the innovation diffusion context.  It is equivalent to the		logistic population growth model.	|Adoption Rate=	(Potential Adopters P*Adoption Fraction i*Contact Rate c)*Adopters A/Total Population N	~	People/Day	~	The adoption rate is the total number of encounters Sc multiplied by the \		probability that any of those encounters is with an adopter A/N, and \		finally multiplied by the probability that an encounter with an adopter \		person results in adoption by the potential adopter, i.	|Total Population N=	10000	~	People	~	N is the total population in the community	|Contact Rate c=	2	~	1/Day	~	People in the community interact at a certain rate (the Contact Rate, c, \		measured in people contacted per person per time period, or 1/time \		periods).	|Adopters A= INTEG (	Adoption Rate,		Initial Adopters Population)	~	People	~	The total population of the community or region considered is divided into \		two categories: potential adopters P and adopters A	|Initial Adopters Population=	1	~	People	~	The initial number of adopters in the population.	|Adoption Fraction i=	0.5	~	fraction	~	The adoption fraction (i) is the probability that a person will adopt the \		innovation after exposure to an adopter.  It is analogous to the \		infectivity of a disease.	|Potential Adopters P= INTEG (	-Adoption Rate,		1000)	~	People	~	The total population of the community or region considered is divided into \		two categories:  potential adopters P and Adopters A.	|********************************************************	.Control********************************************************~		Simulation Control Paramaters	|FINAL TIME  = 120	~	Day	~	The final time for the simulation.	|INITIAL TIME  = 0	~	Day	~	The initial time for the simulation.	|SAVEPER  =         TIME STEP	~	Day	~	The frequency with which output is stored.	|TIME STEP  = 0.125	~	Day	~	The time step for the simulation.	|\\\---/// Sketch information - do not modify anything except namesV300  Do not put anything below this section - it will be ignored*View 1$0,0,Helvetica|10|B|0-0-0|0-0-0|0-0-0|-1--1--1|-1--1--1|0,010,1,Potential Adopters P,196,123,40,20,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,010,2,Adopters A,462,121,40,20,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,3,5,2,4,0,0,22,0,0,0,-1--1--1,,1|(378,122)|1,4,5,1,100,0,0,22,0,0,0,-1--1--1,,1|(279,122)|11,5,284,329,122,6,8,34,3,0,0,1,0,0,010,6,Adoption Rate,329,159,34,29,40,3,0,0,-1,0,0,01,7,1,6,1,0,43,0,0,64,0,-1--1--1,,1|(236,199)|1,8,2,6,1,0,43,0,0,64,0,-1--1--1,,1|(411,197)|10,9,Adoption Fraction i,437,261,34,15,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,010,10,Contact Rate c,220,259,31,19,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,11,10,6,1,0,43,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(301,223)|1,12,9,6,1,0,43,0,0,64,0,-1--1--1,,1|(370,226)|12,13,0,262,150,15,15,5,4,0,0,-1,0,0,0B12,14,0,397,151,15,15,4,4,0,0,-1,0,0,0R10,15,Total Population N,287,308,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,01,16,15,6,1,0,45,0,0,192,0,-1--1--1,,1|(334,220)|12,17,0,262,180,31,19,8,4,0,8,-1,0,0,0,0-0-0,0-0-0,|8|B|0-0-0Market Saturation12,18,0,396,178,25,22,8,4,0,8,-1,0,0,0,0-0-0,0-0-0,|8|B|0-0-0Word of Mouth10,19,Initial Adopters Population,604,123,40,20,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0///---\\\:L<%^E!@
