		Pink Noise
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		Generates first-order serially correlated noise using
		a uniform distribution for the white noise input.
		See Appendix B.
	|

Change in Pink Noise = (White Noise - Pink Noise)/Correlation Time
	~	1/Period
	~	Change in the pink noise value; Pink noise is a first order exponential smoothing \
		delay of the white
		         noise input.
	|

Correlation Time=
	1
	~	Periods
	~	The correlation time constant for the pink noise.
	|

Mean=
	0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The mean of the pink noise process.
	|

Noise Seed=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The noise seed determines which sequence of realizations for the random \
		process are used.  Simulations with the same noise seed will yield the \
		same sequence, so different simulations can be compared.  Changing the see \
		changes the realizations.
	|

Standard Deviation = 0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The standard deviation of the pink noise process.
	|

Pink Noise= INTEG (
	Change in Pink Noise,
		Mean)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Pink Noise is first-order autocorrelated noise.  Pink noise provides a realistic \
		noise input to
		        models in which the next random shock depends in part on the previous \
		shocks.  The user
		        can specify the correlation time.  The mean and standard deviation are \
		specified
		         by the user.
	|

White Noise=
	 Mean + Standard Deviation*((24*Correlation Time/TIME STEP)^0.5*(RANDOM UNIFORM(-0.5\
		, 0.5, Noise Seed)
	))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	White noise input to the pink noise process.  The user specified the mean, \
		standard deviation, and noise seed.  The white noise input is drawn from a \
		uniform distrib ution, then scaled to yield the correct standard deviation \
		for the pink noise.

FINAL TIME  = 100
	~	Period
	~	The final time for the simulation.

INITIAL TIME  = 0
	~	Period
	~	The initial time for the simulation.

SAVEPER  =

	~	Period
	~	The frequency with which output is stored.

TIME STEP  = 0.125
	~	Period
	~	The time step for the simulation.
