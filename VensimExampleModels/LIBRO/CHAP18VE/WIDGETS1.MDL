		One-Stage Supply Chain Model with Materials Delivery
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model extends the basic supply chain model developed in chapter 18
		to include an explicit inventory of materials.  Materials are delivered 
		immediately, so the Material Delivery Rate equals the Desired Material
		Delivery Rate. The two-stage models relax this assumption by modeling
		the supplier explicitly.
	|

Desired Material Inventory Coverage=
	Minimum Material Inventory Coverage + Material Safety Stock Coverage
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired materials inventory coverage is the sum of the minimum coverage \
		required and the materials inventory safety stock coverage.
	|

Desired Material Inventory=
	Desired Material Usage Rate*Desired Material Inventory Coverage
	~	Materials
	~	The desired stock of materials is determined by the desired materials \
		usage rate and the target inventory coverage.
	|

Adjustment for Material Inventory=
	(Desired Material Inventory - Materials Inventory)/Material Inventory Adjustment Time
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The desired material delivery rate is adjusted in proportion to the gap \
		between the desired and actual material inventory.  The material inventory \
		adjustrment time represents the time over which the firm seeks to \
		eliminate materials inventory shortfalls or surpluses.
	|

Maximum Material Usage Rate=
	Materials Inventory/Minimum Material Inventory Coverage
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The maximum rate of materials usage the firm can achieve given their \
		current materials inventories and the minimum inventory coverage for \
		materials.
	|

Minimum Material Inventory Coverage=
	1
	~	Weeks
	~	The minimum time required to prepare and utilize materials.
	|

Desired Material Usage Rate=
	MAX(0, Desired Production Start Rate*Material Usage per Unit)
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The rate at which the firm seeks to use materials is determined by the \
		desired production start rate and the number of material units used per \
		unit of output.  The desired usage rate must remain nonnegative.
	|

Production Start Rate=
	Feasible Production Starts from Materials
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	Production is started at the rate materials usage permits.
	|

Material Usage Ratio=
	 Table for Material Usage(Maximum Material Usage Rate/Desired Material Usage Rate)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of the desired material usage rate the firm can achieve is \
		determined by the ratio of the maximum material usage rate to the desired \
		usage rate.  The maximum rate is the rate current materials inventory \
		permits.  Low inventory availability reduces usage below planned rates.
	|

Materials Inventory= INTEG (
	Material Delivery Rate-Material Usage Rate,
		Desired Material Inventory)
	~	Materials
	~	The stock of raw materials.
	|

Materials Inventory Coverage=
	Materials Inventory/Material Usage Rate
	~	Weeks
	~	Material Inventory coverage at any time is the materials inventory divided \
		by the usage rate.
	|

	Desired Material Usage Rate + Adjustment for Material Inventory
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The desired material delivery rate is the desired material usage rate \
		adjusted by an amount designed to move the materials inventory towards its \
		desired level.
	|

Material Safety Stock Coverage=
	1
	~	Week
	~	Material safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the desired \
		material usage rate the firm would like to maintain in materials inventory \
		over and above the minimum material coverage.  The safety stock provides a \
		buffer against the possibility that unforeseen variations in production \
		plans will cause production to fall below the desired rate.
	|

Material Usage per Unit=
	1
	~	Materials/Widget
	~	The quantity of materials used per widget.
	|

Material Usage Rate=
	Desired Material Usage Rate*Material Usage Ratio
	~	Materials/Week
	~	The material usage rate is the desired usage rate multiplied by the \
		fraction of the desired rate achieved (the material usage ratio).   Usage \
		falls below desired usage when the feasible usage rate falls below the \
		desired rate, indicating that some materials are unavailable.
	|

Feasible Production Starts from Materials=
	Material Usage Rate/Material Usage per Unit
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The feasible rate of production from materials is the number of units that \
		may be started based on the current rate of materials usage divided by the \
		number of materials units used in each unit of output.
	|

	[(0,0)-(2,1)],(0,0),(0.2,0.2),(0.4,0.4),(0.6,0.58),(0.8,0.73),(1,0.85),(1.2,0.93),(1.4\
		,0.97),(1.6,0.99),(1.8,1),(2,1),(2,1))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ability to ship is constrained by inventory availability.  As the inventory \
		level drops, the 
		        fraction of customer orders that can be filled decreases.  When inventory is \
		zero, shipments
		         cease.  Unfilled customer orders are lost.\!\!\!

	~	Weeks
	~	The average delivery delay is given by the ratio of the backlog to the \
		current shipment rate.

		exponential smoothing,
		         a widely used forecasting technique.

	|

Order Fulfillment Ratio=

	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \
		normal shipment rate to the desired rate.  The normal rate is the rate \
		current inventory permits under normal circumstances.  Low inventory \
		availability reduces shipments below customer orders.  Unfilled customer \
		orders are lost.
	|

	2
	~	Weeks
	~	The firm's target for delivery time.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio

		seeks to maintain
		        in inventory.  This inventory coverage is required to maintain delivery \
		reliability by
		         buffering the plant against unforeseen variations in demand or \
		production.  It consists of the normal order processing time plus an \
		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.
	|

Maximum Shipment Rate=
	Inventory/Minimum Order Processing Time
	~	Widgets/Week

	|

Safety Stock Coverage=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \

		order processing time.  The safety stock provides a buffer against the \
		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Inventory = INTEG(Production Rate-Shipment Rate,Desired Inventory)
	~	Widgets
	~	The level of finished goods inventory in the plant.  Increased by production and \
		decreased by

	|

Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage*Expected Order Rate
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired inventory level sought by the plant.  Experience suggests that to \

	|

Expected Order Rate = INTEG(Change in Exp Orders,Customer Order Rate)
