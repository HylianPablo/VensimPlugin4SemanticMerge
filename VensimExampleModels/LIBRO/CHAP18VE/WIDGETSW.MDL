		One-Stage Supply Chain Model with Order Backlog
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model extends the basic supply chain model developed in chapter 18
		to include an explicit backlog of unfilled orders.
	|

Delivery Delay=
	Backlog/Order Fulfillment Rate
	~	Weeks
	~	The average delivery delay is given by the ratio of the backlog to the \
		current shipment rate.
	|

Order Fulfillment Rate=
	Shipment Rate
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The order fulfillment rate is equal to the physical shipment rate.
	|

Backlog= INTEG (
	+Order Rate-Order Fulfillment Rate,
		Order Rate * Target Delivery Delay)
	~	Widgets
	~	The firm's backlog of unfilled orders
	|

Change in Exp Orders=
	 (Customer Order Rate-Expected Order Rate)/
	Time to Average Order Rate
	~	(Widgets/Week)/Week
	~	The demand forecast adjusts to the actual order rate over a time period determined \
		by the Time to
		        Average Order Rate.  The demand forecast is formed by first-order \
		exponential smoothing,
		         a widely used forecasting technique.
	|

Order Rate=
	Customer Order Rate
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The incoming order rate, equal to customer orders.
	|

Desired Shipment Rate=
	Backlog/Target Delivery Delay
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired shipment rate is determined by the backlog and the target \
		delivery delay.
	|

Order Fulfillment Ratio=
	 Table for Order Fulfillment(Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \
		normal shipment rate to the desired rate.  The normal rate is the rate \
		current inventory permits under normal circumstances.  Low inventory \
		availability reduces shipments below customer orders.  Unfilled customer \
		orders are lost.
	|

Target Delivery Delay=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	The firm's target for delivery time.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \
		of orders filled (the order fulfillment ratio.   Shipments fall below \
		desired shipments when the feasible shipment rate falls below the desired \
		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.
	|

Ratio of Maximum to Desired Shipments=
	Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ratio of the maximum to desired shipment rate.  Ratios less than one \
		indicate shipments are constrained below the desired level.
	|

Inventory Coverage=
	Inventory/Shipment Rate
	~	Weeks
	~	Inventory coverage is given by the ratio of inventory to shipments.
	|

Desired Inventory Coverage=
	 Minimum Order Processing Time + Safety Stock Coverage
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired inventory coverage is the number of weeks of the demand forecast the plant \
		seeks to maintain
		        in inventory.  This inventory coverage is required to maintain delivery \
		reliability by
		         buffering the plant against unforeseen variations in demand or \
		production.  It consists of the normal order processing time plus an \
		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.
	|

Maximum Shipment Rate=
	Inventory/Minimum Order Processing Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The maximum rate of shipments the firm can achieve given their current \
		inventory level and the minimum order processing time.
	|

Minimum Order Processing Time=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	The minimum time required to process and ship an order.
	|

Safety Stock Coverage=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \
		the firm would like to maintain in inventory over and above the normal \
		order processing time.  The safety stock provides a buffer against the \
		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Inventory = INTEG(Production Rate-Shipment Rate,Desired Inventory)
	~	Widgets
	~	The level of finished goods inventory in the plant.  Increased by production and \
		decreased by
		         shipments.  Initially set to the desired inventory level.
	|

Table for Order Fulfillment(
	[(0,0)-(2,1)],(0,0),(0.2,0.2),(0.4,0.4),(0.6,0.58),(0.8,0.73),(1,0.85),(1.2,0.93),(1.4\
		,0.97),(1.6,0.99),(1.8,1),(2,1),(2,1))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ability to ship is constrained by inventory availability.  As the inventory \
		level drops, the 
		        fraction of customer orders that can be filled decreases.  When inventory is \
		zero, shipments
		         cease.  Unfilled customer orders are lost.\!\!\!
	|

Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage*Expected Order Rate
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired inventory level sought by the plant.  Experience suggests that to \
		maintain customer
		        service by providing full and reliable deliveries, the plant must maintain a \
		certain
		         coverage of throughput (demand), estimated by the demand forecast.
	|

Expected Order Rate = INTEG(Change in Exp Orders,Customer Order Rate)
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The demand forecast is formed by adaptive expectations, using exponential smoothing, \
		a common
		         forecasting technique.  The initial forecast is equal to the \
		initial customer order rate.
	|

Time to Average Order Rate = 8
	~	Weeks
	~	The demand forecast adjusts to actual customer orders over this time \
		period.
	|

Production Rate = DELAY3(Production Start Rate,Manufacturing Cycle Time)
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	Production is a third order delay of the production start rate, with the delay time \
		determined by
		         the manufacturing cycle time.
	|

Manufacturing Cycle Time=
	8
	~	Weeks
	~	The average delay between the start and completion of production
	|

Production Start Rate = MAX(0,Desired Production Start Rate)
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The production start rate is the desired production start rate, \
		constrained to be nonnegative.
	|

	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired rate of production starts, equal to the desired production rate adjusted \
		by the adequacy
		         of the WIP inventory.
	|

Adjustment for WIP = (Desired WIP - Work in Process Inventory)/WIP Adjustment Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The adjustment to the production start rate from the adequacy of WIP \
		inventory.
	|

WIP Adjustment Time = 2
	~	Weeks
	~	The time required to adjust the WIP inventory to the desired level.
	|

Work in Process Inventory = INTEG(Production Start Rate - Production Rate,Desired WIP\
		)
	~	Widgets
	~	WIP inventory accumulates the difference between production starts and \
		completions.
	|

Desired WIP = Manufacturing Cycle Time*Desired Production
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired quantity of work in process inventory.  Proportional to the \
		manufacturing cycle time and
		         the desired rate of production.
	|

Desired Production = MAX(0,Expected Order Rate+Adjustment from Inventory)
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	Desired Production is the demand forecast (Expected Order Rate) adjusted to bring \
		the inventory
		         position in line with the target inventory level.
	|

Adjustment from Inventory = (Desired Inventory - Inventory)/
Inventory Adjustment Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired production rate is adjusted above or below the forecast based on the \
		inventory position
		        of the plant.  When desired inventory > inventory, desired production is \
		increased (and
		         vice-versa).  Inventory gaps are corrected over the inv. adj. \
		time.
	|

Inventory Adjustment Time = 8
	~	Weeks
	~	The inventory adjustment time is the time period over which the plant seeks to bring \
		inventory in
		         balance with the desired level.  Initially set to 8 weeks.
	|

Customer Order Rate = Initial Customer Order Rate*Input
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	Customer order rate is exogenous.  A variety of test inputs allow users to try \
		different patterns,
		         including a step, pulse, sine wave, and random noise.

		noise input to
		        models in which the next random shock depends in part on the previous \
		shocks.  The user
		        can specify the correlation time.  The mean is 0 and the standard deviation \
		is specified
