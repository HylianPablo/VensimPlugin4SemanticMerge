		Simple Consumption Multiplier Model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model is used in the challenge on simultaneous initial
		conditions equations in chapter 18.1.
		
		The model represents the consumption multiplier in a simple
		macroeconomic framework.  GDP adjusts to aggregate demand; 
		aggregate demand depends on expectations of permanent income,
		which in turn depend on GDP.
	|

Aggregate Demand=
	Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure
	~	$/Year
	~	Aggreate demand is the sum of consumption, private investment
		and government expenditure.
	|

Change in Expected Income=
	(GDP - Expected Income)/Expectation Formation Time
	~	$/(Year*Year)
	~	Expected income adjusts via first-order smoothing to actual income,
		given by GDP.
	|

Change in GDP=
	(Aggregate Demand - GDP)/Production Adjustment Time
	~	$/Year/Year
	~	GDP adjusts to aggregate demand via first-order smoothing.
	|

Consumption=
	Marginal Propensity to Consume*Expected Income
	~	$/Year
	~	Consumers spend a fraction of their expected or permanent income.
	|

Expectation Formation Time=
	2
	~	Year
	~	The time over which consumers form expectations of their permanent income.
	|

Expected Income= INTEG (
	Change in Expected Income,
		GDP)
	~	$/Year
	~	Consumers' expectations for permanent income.  Set initially to actual \
		income (GDP).
	|

GDP= INTEG (
	Change in GDP, Aggregate Demand)
	~	$/Year
	~	The total value of the flow of goods and services produced in the economy.  \
		Set initially to aggregate demand..
	|

Government Expenditure=
	90+step(10,1)
	~	$/Year
	~	Government expenditure in this illustrative model is exogenous.
	|

Investment=
	10
	~	$/Year
	~	Private investment  in this illustrative model is exogenous.
	|

Marginal Propensity to Consume=
	0.8
	~	dimensionless
	~	The fraction of expected income consumers spend.
	|

Production Adjustment Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Output adjusts to aggregate demand by first-order smoothing with a one \
		year time constant.
