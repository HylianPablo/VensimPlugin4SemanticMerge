		Labor with Layoffs

		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the generic human resources sector developed in chapter 19,
		including layoffs and vacancy cancellations.
	|

Adjustment for Labor=
	(Desired Labor - Labor)/Labor Adjustment Time
	~	People/week
	~	Adjusts the desired hiring rate to bring labor in line with the desired \
		level.
	|

Adjustment for Vacancies=
	(Desired Vacancies - Vacancies)/Vacancy Adjustment Time
	~	People/week
	~	Adjusts vacancy creation so the firm has the desired number of vacancies.
	|

Average Duration of Employment=
	100
	~	Weeks
	~	The average duration of employment is constant in this simple model, but \
		in general depends on labor market and economic conditions, as well as \
		employee satisfaction and other factors internal to the firm.
	|

Average Layoff Time=
	8
	~	Weeks
	~	The average time required to lay off a worker.
	|

Average Time to Fill Vacancies=
	8
	~	Weeks
	~	The average time required to fill a vacancy and bring a new employee into \
		the workforce.
	|

Change in Pink Noise = (White Noise - Pink Noise)/Noise Correlation Time
	~	1/week
	~	Change in the pink noise value; Pink noise is a first order exponential smoothing \
		delay of the white
		         noise input.
	|

Desired Hiring Rate=
	 Expected Attrition Rate + Adjustment for Labor
	~	People/week
	~	The firm seeks to hire enough people to replace expected attrition and \
		adjust the labor force to the desired level.
	|

Desired Labor = Initial Desired Labor*Input
	~	People
	~	Desired Labor is exogenous.  A variety of test inputs allow users to try different \
		patterns,
		         including a step, pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Desired Lay Off Rate=
	Willingness to Lay Off * MAX(0, -Desired Hiring Rate)
	~	People/week
	~	The firm desires to lay people off whenever the desired hiring rate is \
		negative, modified by their willingness to lay off.  Willingness to Lay \
		Off = 0 implies a no layoff policy.
	|

Desired Vacancies=
	MAX(0,Expected Time to Fill Vacancies*Desired Hiring Rate)
	~	People
	~	The number of vacancies needed to generate the desired hiring rate, given \
		the expected time required to fill a vacancy.
	|

Desired Vacancy Cancellation Rate=
	MAX(0, -Desired Vacancy Creation Rate)
	~	People/week
	~	The desired rate of vacancy cancellation, given by the desired vacancy \
		creation rate whenever that rate is negative.
	|

Desired Vacancy Creation Rate=
	Desired Hiring Rate + Adjustment for Vacancies
	~	People/week
	~	The firm seeks to create enough vacancies to yield the desired hiring \
		rate, adjusted to bring the stock of vacancies in line with the desired \
		stock.
	|

Expected Attrition Rate=
	Quit Rate
	~	People/week
	~	In this simple model expected attrition is set to the actual voluntary \
		quit rate.
	|

Expected Time to Fill Vacancies=
	Average Time to Fill Vacancies
	~	Weeks
	~	The expected time required to fill vacancies.  In this simple model, set \
		to the actual time.  A better formulation would use an information delay \
		to represent the delay in gathering information about hiring delays and \
		changing procedures.
	|

Hiring Rate=
	Vacancies/Average Time to Fill Vacancies
	~	People/week
	~	Hiring depends on the number of open vacancies and the average time \
		required to fill a vacancy.
	|

Initial Desired Labor=
	 1000
	~	People
	~	Initial value of Desired Labor
	|

Input=
	1+STEP(Step Height,Step Time)+
	(Pulse Quantity/TIME STEP)*PULSE(Pulse Time,TIME STEP)+
	RAMP(Ramp Slope,Ramp Start Time,Ramp End Time)+
	Sine Amplitude*SIN(2*3.14159*Time/Sine Period)+
  	STEP(1,Noise Start Time)*Pink Noise
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Input is a dimensionless variable which provides a variety of test input patterns, \
		including a step,
		         pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Labor= INTEG (
	Hiring Rate - Quit Rate - Layoff Rate,
		Desired Labor)
	~	People
	~	The labor force of the firm.

	~	Weeks
	~	The time period over which the firm seeks to bring the labor force in line \
		with the desired level.
	|

Layoff Rate=
	MIN(Desired Lay Off Rate, Maximum Layoff Rate)
	~	People/week
	~	The layoff rate is the lesser of the desired or maximum rate.
	|

Maximum Layoff Rate=
	Labor/Average Layoff Time
	~	People/week
	~	The maximum layoff rate is determined by the number of workers and the \
		layoff time.
	|

Maximum Vacancy Cancellation Rate=
	Vacancies/Vacancy Cancellation Time
	~	People/week
	~	The maximum vacancy cancellation rate is determined by the numer of \
		vacancies outstanding and the minimum cancellation time.
	|

Noise Correlation Time = 4
	~	week
	~	The correlation time constant for Pink Noise.
	|

Noise Standard Deviation = 0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The standard deviation of the pink noise process.
	|

	~	week
	~	Start time for the random input.
	|

Pink Noise = INTEG(Change in Pink Noise,0)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Pink Noise is first-order autocorrelated noise.  Pink noise provides a realistic \
		noise input to
		        models in which the next random shock depends in part on the previous \
		shocks.  The user
		        can specify the correlation time.  The mean is 0 and the standard deviation \
		is specified
		         by the user.
	|

Pulse Quantity=0
	~	Dimensionless*week
	~	The quantity to be injected to customer orders, as a fraction of the base value of \
		Input. 
		        For example, to pulse in a quantity equal to 50% of the current value of \
		input, set to
		         .50.
	|

	~	End time for the ramp input.
	|

Ramp Slope=0
	~	1/week
	~	Slope of the ramp input, as a fraction of the base value (per week).

		of vacancies to the desired level.
	|

Vacancy Cancellation Rate=
	 MIN(Desired Vacancy Cancellation Rate, Maximum Vacancy Cancellation Rate)
	~	People/week
	~	The rate at which the firm cancels existing vacancies prior to filling \
		them.
	|

Vacancy Cancellation Time=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	The average time required to cancel a vacancy.
	|

Vacancy Closure Rate=

	~	People/week
	~	The rate at which the firm authorizes new positions and begins to recruit \
		for them.
	|

White Noise = Noise Standard Deviation*((24*Noise Correlation Time/TIME STEP)^0.5*(RANDOM 0 1\
		() - 0.5
))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	White noise input to the pink noise process.
	|

Willingness to Lay Off=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The willingness to layoff employees.  Zero = no layoff policy; 1 implies \
		the firm is just as willing to layoff employees when there are too many as \
		to hire when there are too few.
