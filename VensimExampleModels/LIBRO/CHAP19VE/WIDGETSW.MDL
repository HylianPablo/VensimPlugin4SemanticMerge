		Models interactions between a firm's inventory management policies and its
		human resource policies.  The model is developed and tested in chapter 19.
		This version includes the structure for over- and under-time.
	|

	(Desired Labor - Labor)/Labor Adjustment Time
	~	People/Week
	~	Adjusts the desired hiring rate to bring labor in line with the desired \
		level.
	|

	(Desired Vacancies - Vacancies)/Vacancy Adjustment Time
	~	People/Week
	~	Adjusts vacancy creation so the firm has the desired number of vacancies.
	|

	~	People/Week
	~	In this simple model expected attrition is set to the actual voluntary \
		quit rate.
	|

Average Duration of Employment=
	100

		in general depends on labor market and economic conditions, as well as \
		employee satisfaction and other factors internal to the firm.

	|

Expected Time to Fill Vacancies=
	Average Time to Fill Vacancies
	~	Weeks

	|

Willingness to Lay Off=
	1

Order Fulfillment Ratio=
	 Table for Order Fulfillment(Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \

		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.
	|

Desired Shipment Rate=
	Customer Order Rate
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired shipment rate equals the customer order rate.  In this model \

	|

Desired Inventory Coverage=
	 Minimum Order Processing Time + Safety Stock Coverage
	~	Weeks
	~	Desired inventory coverage is the number of weeks of the demand forecast the plant \

		reliability by
		         buffering the plant against unforeseen variations in demand or \
		production.  It consists of the normal order processing time plus an \
		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.
	|

Maximum Shipment Rate=

	~	The minimum time required to process and ship an order.
	|

Safety Stock Coverage=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \
		the firm would like to maintain in inventory over and above the normal \
		order processing time.  The safety stock provides a buffer against the \
		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Inventory = INTEG(Production Rate-Shipment Rate,Desired Inventory)

	~	The level of finished goods inventory in the plant.  Increased by production and \
		decreased by

		,0.97),(1.6,0.99),(1.8,1),(2,1),(2,1))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ability to ship is constrained by inventory availability.  As the inventory \
		level drops, the 
		        fraction of customer orders that can be filled decreases.  When inventory is \
		zero, shipments
		         cease.  Unfilled customer orders are lost.\!\!\!
	|

Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage*Expected Order Rate
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired inventory level sought by the plant.  Experience suggests that to \

Inventory Adjustment Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired production rate is adjusted above or below the forecast based on the \
		inventory position
		        of the plant.  When desired inventory > inventory, desired production is \
		increased (and
