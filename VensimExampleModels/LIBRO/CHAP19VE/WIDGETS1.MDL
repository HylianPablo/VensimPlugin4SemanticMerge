		human resource policies.  The model is developed and tested in chapter 19.
		This version does not include overtime.

		and the workweek.
	|

Switch for Labor in Production=
	1
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Switch = 1 implies production starts are determined by the labor force.  \
		When Switch = 0, production starts equal desired production starts.
	|

Adjustment for Labor=
	(Desired Labor - Labor)/Labor Adjustment Time
	~	People/Week

	Willingness to Lay Off * MAX(0, -Desired Hiring Rate)
	~	People/Week
	~	The firm desires to lay people off whenever the desired hiring rate is \

	Average Time to Fill Vacancies
	~	Weeks

	|

Ratio of Maximum to Desired Shipments=
	Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ratio of the maximum to desired shipment rate.  Ratios less than one \
		indicate shipments are constrained below the desired level.
	|

Order Fulfillment Ratio=
	 Table for Order Fulfillment(Maximum Shipment Rate/Desired Shipment Rate)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \
		normal shipment rate to the desired rate.  The normal rate is the rate \
		current inventory permits under normal circumstances.  Low inventory \
		availability reduces shipments below customer orders.  Unfilled customer \
		orders are lost.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \
		of orders filled (the order fulfillment ratio.   Shipments fall below \

		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.
	|

Desired Shipment Rate=
	Customer Order Rate
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired shipment rate equals the customer order rate.  In this model \

		reliability by
		         buffering the plant against unforeseen variations in demand or \
		production.  It consists of the normal order processing time plus an \
		additional term representing the coverage desired to maintain safety \
		stocks.

	|

Safety Stock Coverage=
	2
	~	Weeks
	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \
		the firm would like to maintain in inventory over and above the normal \
		order processing time.  The safety stock provides a buffer against the \
		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Inventory = INTEG(Production Rate-Shipment Rate,Desired Inventory)
	~	Widgets
	~	The level of finished goods inventory in the plant.  Increased by production and \
		decreased by
		         shipments.  Initially set to the desired inventory level.
	|

Table for Order Fulfillment(

		,0.97),(1.6,0.99),(1.8,1),(2,1),(2,1))
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The ability to ship is constrained by inventory availability.  As the inventory \
		level drops, the 
		        fraction of customer orders that can be filled decreases.  When inventory is \
		zero, shipments
		         cease.  Unfilled customer orders are lost.\!\!\!
	|

Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage*Expected Order Rate
	~	Widgets
	~	The desired inventory level sought by the plant.  Experience suggests that to \
		maintain customer

Time to Average Order Rate
	~	(Widgets/Week)/Week
	~	The demand forecast adjusts to the actual order rate over a time period determined \

		exponential smoothing,
		         a widely used forecasting technique.

Inventory Adjustment Time
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The desired production rate is adjusted above or below the forecast based on the \
		inventory position
		        of the plant.  When desired inventory > inventory, desired production is \
		increased (and
		         vice-versa).  Inventory gaps are corrected over the inv. adj. \
